# Polymer glass contact mechanics

This is an analysis package for contact mechanics and polymer simulations perfomed using Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS).

It could be used to:
1) Analyze relative monomer motion.
2) Create crystal structures, polymer melts and different atomistic geometric structures.
3) Get statistical information on polymer melts.
4) Analyze plastic rearrangements in indentation experiments on polymer glasses.
5) Simulate Hertz contact distribution.
6) Create self affine rough surfaces from power spectrum density.
7) Parse various thermodynamic outputs.
